Same disclaimer applies as with all previous H3 named, kind of sketchy and class specific code.  Specific notes about the fight:
- Fighter will pull/tank celestial materia.  Mystic will tank the named.
- Before pull, fighter will aggro the 4 celestial materia without aggroing the named
	- The far 2 will be pet pulled, and this assumes you have a character capable of pet pulling
- At pull, group will aggro the named and Priest completes an HO to gain aggro
	- Flecks of regret is left on the priest, only cured every 5 minutes to keep it from ticking too high
		- The remaining non-mage characters use Zimaran Cure Elemental pots to cure themselves (no guarantee the priest will be in range to cure)
	- Characters joust as needed to match increments
	- Named will cast "Absorb Celestial Materia" on a timer
		- Class-specific code setup to interrupt it
	- Characters will get Heliocentric detrimental on a timer requiring them to be a specific distance away from named
	- Changing Theory triggers at start of fight then every 10% requiring matching new increments as it expires or a wipe
	- The general strategy throughout the fight is to try to not have Changing Theory go off at the same time as Helio
		- The script keeps track of the last time a character got Helio and when it is expected to happen again
		- When coming up on an HP threshold to trigger Changing Theory will stop dps until it is safe to continue at a time when Helio shouldn't happen
		- This makes the fight take a long time, but should make it more reliable (my first kill was ~18 minutes)
- At ~60% the named will start casting Mezzy Situation on group
	- Will mez immunity rune, can ignore it
- If you wipe, end the script and clear campspot, then revive at "The Golden Terrace" and start the script up again.  It will recognize the respawn point as a start to jump to 3rd named.
